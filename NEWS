         Orocos Components Library (OCL) v1.8.2

This bug-fix release of the Orocos Components Library is aimed at the
Real-Time Toolkit v1.8.x. Build problems on Mac-OS-X and a build 
problem with KDL 1.0 have been fixed. The ctaskbrowser now loads type 
plugins as well (but only from /usr/lib/rtt/..target../plugins), 
an ocl-config.h header was added with version info and
reported build/link problems have been fixed.

This release of the Orocos Components Library is aimed at the
Real-Time Toolkit v1.6.1. and contains minor portability and
compiler fixes, an update to the Comedi pulse train generation and
documentation updates.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
         Orocos Components Library (OCL) v1.6.0

This release of the Orocos Components Library is aimed at the
Real-Time Toolkit v1.6.0. and offers improved functionality for

 deb http://svn.fmtc.be/debian etch main

Major improvements are:
 * Upgraded to the recent comedilib 0.8.1 release
 * Improved error reporting of automatic component deployment
 * Improved setting up distributed applications from XML files.
 * Most components are dynamically loadable
 * Support for logging to the NetCDF file format

A new stand-alone application has been added as well: 

deployer-corba:
 A task-browser application which can connect local components to
 remote components by looking up the name, IOR file or plain IOR. It
 is a CORBA server itself as well.

         Orocos Components Library (OCL) v1.4.1

This is the first bug fix release of the Orocos Components Library v1.4
and only contains backwards compatible fixes.

Some components are available as Debian 'Etch' packages for GNU/Linux,
RTAI/LXRT and Xenomai. They can be found here:

         Orocos Components Library (OCL) v1.4.0

This release of the Orocos Components Library is aimed at the
Real-Time Toolkit v1.4.0. and offers improved functionality for
loading and configuring components dynamically at run-time.  The OCL
major version (1.4) has been made identical to the RTT major version
in order to ease matching the correct versions of both libraries. Some
components of the OCL library are now also available as Debian 4.0
'Etch' packages from 
 deb http://svn.fmtc.be/debian etch main

A new stand-alone applications has been added as well:
 cdeployer: loads other components into the current process and
 is accessible over a network using the CORBA transport.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
         Orocos Components Library (OCL) v0.4.1

This release offers improvements to the TaskBrowser, Deployment and
Reporting component. The TaskBrowser shows an improved component
interface and status view upon the 'ls' command and also stores and
loads history of previous sessions to a history file, allowing you to
search, execute or list commands of previous sessions. The Deployment
component has been further tested and protects you against loading the
same library twice with different versions (which would cause a
crash).  The Reporting component outputs a new single line header,
starting with a hash (#) mark and naming the columns as in
'Component.Port.index', which allows greatly improved plotting with
the KDE 3 'kst' application.

The documentation had its gradual update as well.

This release of the Orocos Components Library is aimed at
the Real-Time Toolkit v1.2.0. and offers new functionality
for loading and configuring components dynamically at run-time.

Two new stand-alone applications have been added as well:
 deployer: loads other components into the current process
 ctaskbrowser: connects the TaskBrowser to a networked component [CORBA required]
