    <title>Introduction</title>
    <para>
      This document describes the Orocos
      <classname>OCL::DeploymentComponent</classname> for loading and
      configuring other components using an Orocos script or XML
      file. This component can only load components into the same
      process.
    </para>
    <section>
      <title>Principle</title>
      <para>
	Each Orocos component can be compiled as a shared, dynamic loadable
	library. Each such library can define a special
	function which will allow the DeploymentComponent to create new
	instances of a component type. This principle is analogous
	to the plugin mechanism found in web browsers or other desktop
	applications.
      </para>
      <para>
	A common usage scenario of the DeploymentComponent goes as
	follows. An initial Orocos application is created which contains
	only the DeploymentComponent and the
	<classname>OCL::TaskBrowser</classname>. When the application is
	started, the TaskBrowser prompts for commands which can be given
	to the DeploymentComponent.
      </para>

	These three steps can be described in an XML file format or using the command
	prompt.
	</para></caption>
      </mediaobject>
      </figure>
      <para> 
	<xref linkend="fig-deployment-overview" /> shows the basic
	steps.  An XML file contains instructions for the
	DeploymentComponent where to look for components ('import
	statements'), which component types to create, which name they
	must be given and how their internal thread is configured
	(priorities, periods,...). Furthermore this file describes the
	network interconnections between all components and how data
	must be relayed from one component to another. The
	<function>loadComponents("file.xml")</function> method reads
	this file, looks up the components, creates them and stores
	the configuration parameters. One can apply the configuration
	(threads, properties, data connections,...) by calling
	<function>configureComponents()</function>. After this step,
	the components (and the application as a whole) can be started
	with <function>startComponents()</function>. In order to do
	these steps at once, you can just write
	<function>kickStart("file.xml")</function>.
      </para>
      <para>
	The configuration does not need to be stored in XML format.
	One can apply the same configuration by using the scripting
	methods of the DeploymentComponent at the console prompt,
	or by listing them in an Orocos script.
      </para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>The Orocos Deployer Application</title>
      <para>
	The Orocos Component Library provides a number of ready to use
	applications for loading and starting components using the
	DeployementComponent.
      </para>
      <para>
	The main application is the
	<command>deployer-&lt;target&gt;</command> program, where
	<emphasis>&lt;target&gt;</emphasis> is replaced by the
	Operating System target (OROCOS_TARGET) for which you want to
	load components, for example
	<command>deployer-gnulinux</command>.  The program can take an
	optional argument <option>--start filename.xml</option> which
	describes the components to load and is used to kick-start the
	application. The XML specification is described below. When the
	application is started, the TaskBrowser is presented to the
	user for receiving interactive commands. The name of the DeploymentComponent
	is by default 'Deployer'. In order to change this name, use for example
	<command>deployer-gnulinux NewDeployerName</command>. See
	also <command>deployer-&lt;target&gt; --help</command> for an overview
	of the options.
      </para>
      <para>
	There are three related programs to the deployer application.
	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem><para><command>cdeployer-&lt;target&gt;</command>:
	  like above but starts the CORBA enabled non-interactive
	  deployer application. You are not presented with a
	  TaskBrowser prompt, but the cdeployer tries to connect to a
	  CORBA Naming Service, and if that fails, prints the IOR to a
	  file and to the screen.</para></listitem>
	  <listitem><para><command>ctaskbrowser-&lt;target&gt;
	  ComponentName|IOR</command>: Connects to a remote component
	  (like the cdeployer above) using the CORBA
	  <emphasis>IOR</emphasis> address or using the CORBA Naming
	  Service using
	  <emphasis>ComponentName</emphasis>.</para></listitem>
	  <listitem><para><command>deployer-corba-&lt;target&gt;</command>:
	  Combines the cdeployer and deployer applications. It presents
	  the TaskBrowser console and sets up a CORBA server. It can thus be
	  commanded locally and accessed over a network. If you quit
	  the TaskBrowser prompt, the application exits.</para></listitem>
	</itemizedlist>
      </para>
      <para>
	The complete list of options for the deployer, cdeployer and 
	deployer-corba programs are:
	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem><para><command>--help</command>Show program usage</para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem><para><command>--start xml-file</command> (also -s) Deploy the
	  <emphasis>xml-file</emphasis>.</para></listitem>
	  <listitem><para><command>--log-level level</command> (also -l) Sets the 
		  Orocos log level to <emphasis>level</emphasis>. The level parameter 
		  should be one of: Never, Fatal, Critical, Error, Warning, Info, 
		  Debug, or Realtime. The parameter is case-insensitive. Warning: this 
		  <emphasis>overrides</emphasis> the ORO_LOGLEVEL environment 
		  variable.</para></listitem>
	  <listitem><para><command>--no-consolelog</command> Turn off logging to
		  the console (will still log to 'orocos.log')</para></listitem>
	  <listitem><para><command>--DeployerName deployer-name</command> Name of 
		  deployer component (the --DeployerName flag is optional)</para></listitem>
	</itemizedlist>
      </para>
	  <para>Additionally, any CORBA options can be passed through these programs
	  by adding a "--" command line option, followed by the CORBA-specific
	  options.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	  Some examples are
	  <programlisting>
  deployer-corba --log-level warning -s myfile.xml
	  </programlisting>
	  Sets the Orocos log level to <function>warning</function> and deploys
	  file <function>myfile.xml</function>

	  <programlisting>
  deployer-corba -l fatal --no-consolelog -s leftfile.xml LeftDeployer
	  </programlisting>
	  Sets the Orocos log level to <function>fatal</function>, turns off all
	  logging to console, names the deployer <function>LeftDeployer</function>
	  and deploys file <function>leftfile.xml</function>

	  <programlisting>
  deployer-corba -l fatal --no-consolelog -s leftfile.xml LeftDeployer -- -ORBInitRef NameService=corbaloc:iiop:me.mine.home:2809/NameService -ORBFooBar 1
	  </programlisting>
	  As with the previous example, and also passes some options through to the
	  CORBA layer.
	  </para>
	  <para> For more information about setting up components such
	  that they can communicate with each other is explained
	  at the end of this manual, in <xref linkend="corba-extensions" />.

      </mediaobject>
      </figure>
      <para>
	The configuration format defines the instructions one can use
	to load and configure Orocos components. One can divide the
	instructions in three groups:
	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem><para>Where to look for component libraries</para></listitem>
	  <listitem><para>Which components to create and with which name</para></listitem>
	  <listitem><para>How each component is setup</para></listitem>
	</itemizedlist>
      </para>
      <para>
	Let's demonstrate this principle with a simple application
	example as shown in <xref linkend="fig-deployment-example"
	/>. We want to setup an application with three components: a
	Reporting component, a 'Controller' and a 'Plant'. The Plant
	component provides access to the hardware, the Controller
	component contains the control algorithm. The Reporting
	component is here to sense the values exchanged and write
	them to a file.

      </figure>
      <section>
	<title>Where to look for component libraries</title>
	<para>
	  The <function>import</function> statement causes all
	  component libraries in a given <emphasis>directory</emphasis> to be pre-loaded.
	  It does not cause any component to be created, but
	  allows the <classname>OCL::DeploymentComponent</classname> to know where the 
	  component libraries are located. This function does not recurse
		and takes an absolute directory or a
		relative directory path to the RTT_COMPONENT_PATH as argument.
	</para>
	<para>
	  In XML, the import statement looks like:
	  <programlisting><![CDATA[<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE properties SYSTEM "cpf.dtd">
<properties>
  <!-- ....  -->

  <!-- Absolute path: -->
  <simple name="Import" type="string"><value>/opt/orocos/lib/orocos/gnulinux/myrobot</value></simple>

  <!-- Botha are relative path to RTT_COMPONENT_PATH: -->
  <simple name="Import" type="string"><value>myrobot</value></simple>

  <simple name="Import" type="string"><value>myrobot/drivers</value></simple>

</properties>]]></programlisting>
	</para>
	<para>
	  The script method equivalent is:
	  <programlisting>  import("myrobot")</programlisting>
	</para>
	<para>
	  Each component library found under the given location is pre-loaded. The
	  import statement will also load libraries that are not components, but this
		practice is not advised for migration towards RTT 2.x. You can explicitly
		load a library using the <function>loadLibrary</function> function. It takes
		an absolute path to a library or a relative path to a library in your
		RTT_COMPONENT_PATH. So <function>import</function> takes a <emphasis>path or directory</emphasis> as argument
		while <function>loadLibrary</function> takes a <emphasis>library name</emphasis> as argument. The
		loadLibrary call does not require you to write the 'lib' and '.so'/'.dll' suffixes so you can
		write 'foo' when you mean 'libfoo.so' or 'subdir/foo' when you mean 'subdir/libfoo.so'.
	</para>
	<para>
	  In XML, the loadLibrary statement looks like:
	  <programlisting><![CDATA[<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE properties SYSTEM "cpf.dtd">
<properties>
  <!-- ....  -->

  <!-- Absolute path: -->
  <simple name="LoadLibrary" type="string"><value>/opt/orocos/lib/orocos/gnulinux/libmyrobot-vision.so</value></simple>

  <!-- Both are relative path to RTT_COMPONENT_PATH: -->
  <!-- Loads rtt_component_path/libmyrobot-vision.so : -->
  <simple name="LoadLibrary" type="string"><value>myrobot-vision</value></simple>

  <!-- Loads rtt_component_path/drivers/libmyrobot-arm.so : -->
  <simple name="LoadLibrary" type="string"><value>drivers/myrobot-arm</value></simple>

</properties>]]></programlisting>
	</para>
	<para>
	  If a loaded library or imported directory contains one or more Orocos components, 
	  the contained component types become available in the next step.
	</para>
	<para>
	  To see the effects of the import function, the available
	  types can be queried by invoking the
	  <function>displayComponentTypes</function> (script) method:
	  <screen>
 (type 'ls' for context info) :displayComponentTypes()
      Got :displayComponentTypes()
 = I can create the following component types:
   OCL::ConsoleReporting
   OCL::FileReporting
   OCL::HelloWorld
(void)</screen>
	</para>
	<para>
	  In order to manage your XML files, one XML file can include
	  another with the 'Include' directive. The include directive
	  may occur at any place in the XML file (but under
	  &lt;properties&gt;) and will be processed as-if the included
	  file is inserted at that point.
	</para>
	<warning>
	  <para>
	    This option is new and experimental and may change in
	    meaning and/or name in the future.
	  </para>
	</warning>
	<para>
	  In XML, the include statement looks like:
	  <programlisting><![CDATA[<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE properties SYSTEM "cpf.dtd">

  <!-- ....  -->

  <simple name="Include" type="string"><value>default-imports.xml</value></simple>

</properties>]]></programlisting>
	</para>
      </section>
      <section>
	<title>Which components to create and with which name</title>
	<para>
	  Import makes components available, but does not create an
	  <emphasis>specific instance</emphasis> yet.  In order to add
	  a component of a given type to the current application,
	  use the <function>loadComponent</function> function:
	</para>
	<para>
	  In XML, the loadComponent statement of a reporting
	  component would look like:
	  <programlisting><![CDATA[<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE properties SYSTEM "cpf.dtd">
<properties>
  <!-- ... import statements locate Orocos reporting library ...  -->
  <simple name="Import" type="string"><value>/opt/lib/orocos</value></simple>

  <struct name="Reporter" type="OCL::FileReporting">
  </struct>

</properties>]]></programlisting>
	  This line causes the DeploymentComponent to look up
	  the OCL::FileReporting type, and if found, creates
	  a component of that type with the name "Reporter".
	  This component is added as a peer component to the
	  DeploymentComponent such that it becomes immediately
	  available to the application. This step can be
	  repeated any number of times with any number of types.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Alternatively, the type may be a filename if that file
	  contains only one component, which is exported using
	  the <function>createComponent</function> function.
	</para>
	<para>
	  The script method equivalent is:
	  <programlisting>  loadComponent("Reporter", "OCL::FileReporting")</programlisting>
	</para>
      </section>
      <section>
	<title>How each component is setup</title>
	<para>
	  Now that one or more component instances are created, you
	  can configure them by connecting components, assigning
	  threads, configuration values and program scripts. Again,
	  you can do this using XML or the scripting language.

	]]></programlisting>
	<para>
	  Both have periodic activities (indicated by the "Period" element), which run with a
	  given period, priority and in a scheduler. The Controller
	  and Plant run in a real-time scheduler, the Reporter
	  doesn't. The activities are created and attached to each
	  component during the
	  <function>configureComponents()</function> step of the
	  DeploymentComponent. Possible types of activities are
	  <itemizedlist>
	    <listitem><para><option>PeriodicActivity</option> (use only in special cases), </para></listitem>
	  <listitem><para><option>Activity</option> (the standard, recommended one), </para></listitem>

	  <listitem><para><option>SlaveActivity</option> (use only in special cases).</para></listitem>
	  </itemizedlist>
	  The latter activity allows a
	  component to be executed by a master component. You can
	  specify a master component using the <option>Master</option>
	  simple element in the <option>Activity</option> struct. The
	  DeploymentComponent makes slaves automatically a peer of
	  their master, but the master is responsible for calling 'execute()'
	  on its slave peers.
	</para>
	  </section>
	  <section><title>Auto-Configuration and Auto-Starting components.</title>
	<para>
	  The next section of the Controller contains the <option>AutoConf</option> and <option>AutoStart</option>

	<para>
	If <option>AutoConf</option> is set to 1, the DeploymentComponent will call
	  the component's configure() method during <function>configureComponents()</function>,
	  after the properties are loaded. If <option>AutoStart</option> is set to 1, the component's start() 
	  method will be called during <function>startComponents()</function>.
	  By default <option>AutoConf</option> and <option>AutoStart</option> are 0 (off).
	</para></section>
	  <section><title>Connecting Data Ports</title>
	<para>
	  The <option>Ports</option> struct describes which ports of this component
	  participate in which data flow connection. 
	</para>
	    <programlisting><![CDATA[
    <struct name="Ports" type="PropertyBag">

    </struct>
    ]]></programlisting>
	<para>
	So for each element in this
	  struct, the name of the element is the port name, and the value is the
	  name of the connection it belongs to. Ports with equal <emphasis>connection names</emphasis>
	  are connected to each other. The port name itself is <emphasis>not used</emphasis>.
	  If ports of different data types are being connected, the configuration phase
	  will fail.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Looking at the Ports section of the Controller above, it has two data ports listed
	  (SensorValues and SteeringSignals), which are added to
	  two connection objects.  These connections show up in the
	  Plant component's <option>Ports</option> section as well. And it shows that
	  the SensorValues Port is connected to the Position Port and
	  the SteeringSignals Port is connected to the Velocity
	  Port. If other component's ports in the same file refer to
	  the same connection object, the ports are connected to each
	  other by the DeploymentComponent during the
	  <function>configureComponents()</function> step.
	</para>
	</section>
	  <section><title>Loading configuration files - Properties</title>
	<para>
	  The <option>Properties</option> struct allows to configure
	  a component's properties from the main XML file. These values
	  can be overridden by the listed property files:
	</para>
	    <programlisting><![CDATA[
  <!-- You can repeat this struct for each connection below ... -->
    <struct name="Properties" type="PropertyBag">
      <simple name="K" type="double"><value>1.0</value></simple>
    </struct>
    ]]></programlisting>
	<para>
	  The <option>PropertyFile</option> element specifies from
	  which XML file each component is configured and this file
	  <emphasis>must</emphasis> contain values for all properties
	  of the component.
	</para>
	<para>
	  In case you only want to update part of
	  the properties, use the <option>UpdateProperties</option>
	  element. 
	</para>
        <programlisting><![CDATA[
    <simple name="PropertyFile" type="string"><value>controller-main.cpf</value></simple>
    <simple name="UpdateProperties" type="string"><value>controller-opts.cpf</value></simple>
    ]]></programlisting>
	<para>
	  Finally, it is also possible to load and create
	  new properties from a file using <option>LoadProperties</option>
	  the Reporting component requires this for example:
	</para>
        <programlisting><![CDATA[
    <!-- loads/overwrites existing properties in component: -->
    <simple name="LoadProperties" type="string"><value>file-reporting.cpf</value></simple>

    <!-- stores/overwrites properties in a file: -->
    <simple name="StoreProperties" type="string"><value>file-reporting-dump.cpf</value></simple>
    ]]></programlisting>
	<para>	
	  You can use any number or combination of these elements.
	  The order is respected. The properties are read during the
	  <function>configureComponents()</function> step of the
	  DeploymentComponent. When the <option>AutoSave</option>
	  property is turned on, the listed property file will be
	  saved again with the values of the Component, just before
	  the Component is <function>cleanup()</function>.
	</para></section>
	  <section><title>Setting up peer-to-peer relations</title>
	<para>
	  The last section of the Reporter component lists its
	  peers. 
	</para>
        <programlisting><![CDATA[
    <struct name="Peers" type="PropertyBag">
      <simple type="string"><value>Controller</value></simple>
    </struct>
    ]]></programlisting>
	<para>
	The Reporter has one peer, the Controller, which allows
	  the Reporter component to scan and use the interface of the Controller
	  component. For example, it will discover which ports Controller
	  exposes and be able to create connections to them, without the
	  need of a supervisor to do so.
	</para>
	<para>
	  The Controller has at the end two additional elements
	  describing which script files must be loaded into that
	  component: <option>ProgramScript</option> and
	  <option>StateMachineScript</option>. 
	</para>
        <programlisting><![CDATA[
    <simple name="ProgramScript" type="string"><value>controller-program.ops</value></simple>
    <simple name="StateMachineScript" type="string"><value>controller-states.ops</value></simple>
    ]]></programlisting>
	<para>
	  Any number of scripts
	  can be loaded and they are loaded in order.  Both Orocos
	  program scripts and state machine scripts can be
	  loaded. This is again done during the
	  <function>configureComponents()</function> step.
	</para>
      </section>
      <section>
	<title>Include XML files</title>
	<para>
	  The deployer XML format supports include directives, which
	  allow you to manage your application configuration file in
	  different files. This can be useful to separate the OS dependent
	  settings from the OS independent settings, or share XML
	  files between users. The include directive works similar like
	  in "C":
	</para>
	  <programlisting><![CDATA[<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE properties SYSTEM "cpf.dtd">
<properties>
  <!-- ... -->

  <simple name="Include" type="string"><value>common-settings.xml</value></simple>

  <!-- ... -->

</properties>]]></programlisting>
        <para>
	  You can override settings or components in an include file
	  by redefining them after the include statement. The last
	  seen setting is always used by the deployer.
	</para>
	<note>
	  <para>Currently, include directives always look into the
	  current working directory, also when an included file
	  includes a file from another directory.</para>
	</note>
      </section>
      <section id="corba-extensions">
	<title>Setting up remote components: CORBA extensions</title>
        <para>
	  When you distribute components over multiple processes
	  or hosts, you need a way to connect them again to each other.
	  Orocos does this by creating 'proxy' components in processes
	  which act as if they are the remote component. Whatever
	  you do with the proxy also happens with the real component.
	  In order to be able to create a proxy for a real component,
	  the real component must be made a CORBA server.
	</para>
	<para>
	  There are two ways to create CORBA proxies and servers:
	  Using the XML syntax or using the scripting interface.
	</para>
	<para>
	  The deployer XML format allows two CORBA specific boolean
	  properties, which are optional: <option>Server</option>
	  (defaults to '0') and <option>UseNamingService</option>
	  (defaults to '1'). These properties are only used when you
	  use the CORBA enabled
	  <command>cdeployer-&lt;target&gt;</command> or
	  <command>deployer-corba-&lt;target&gt;</command>
	  applications.
	</para>
	<para>
	  <programlisting><![CDATA[<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE properties SYSTEM "cpf.dtd">
<properties>
  <!-- ... -->

  <struct name="Reporter" type="OCL::FileReporting">

    <!-- CORBA specific extensions -->
    <simple name="Server" type="boolean"><value>1</value></simple>
    <simple name="UseNamingService" type="boolean"><value>1</value></simple>

  </struct>

</properties>]]></programlisting>
	</para>
	<para>
	  By default, only the 'Deployer' starts as a CORBA
	  server. You can have other components to start as a server
	  as well by setting the <option>Server</option> property to
	  1. By default, the component will try to use the CORBA
	  Naming Service to register its name. If this is not wanted,
	  set the <option>UseNamingService</option> property to 0.
	</para>
	<para>
	  The script method equivalent of the above XML construct is:
	  <programlisting>  server("Reporter", true)</programlisting>
	  Which will create a CORBA server for the Reporter peer, after
	  the Reporter was loaded with loadComponent().
	</para>
	<para>
	  Or you can create a CORBA server immediately when creating
	  the component by using the 
	  <programlisting>  corbaComponent("Controller", "RobotControllerType")</programlisting>
	  script method, which both creates a server and adds it to the
	  CORBA naming service. You need that in order to access them
	  as shown in the next section.
	</para>
      </section>
      <section>
	<title>Accessing remote CORBA components</title>
	<para>
	  The CORBA enabled deployers allow to create a proxy for a
	  remote component using the name service, the IOR or the IOR file.
	  As such, the remote component will appear as-if it had been
	  loaded in the same process and you can use it like any other
	  loaded component. For example, to start or stop it or to
	  connects some of its ports.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Say you have a remote Orocos component with the name
	  'MyComponent'. It was created in one corba enabled deployer
	  application with the <option>Server</option> property set to 1,
	  or created using the <function>corbaComponent()</function> function.
	</para><para>
	  You can connect to it from another deployer application by using the XML
	  syntax:<programlisting>
<![CDATA[ 
 <!-- Option 1: Uses Naming Service to lookup 'Mycomponent' -->
 <struct name="MyComponent" type="CORBA">
 </struct>

 <!-- Option 2: Uses IOR file to lookup 'Mycomponent' -->
 <struct name="MyComponent.ior" type="IORFile">
 </struct>

 <!-- Option 3: Uses literal IOR to lookup 'Mycomponent' -->
 <struct name="IOR:...." type="IOR">
 </struct>
]]></programlisting>
          Which will make this component available in your current
          application, using the same name as the original.  This also
          works for the scripting deployer command 'loadComponent'.
	  For example, you can type in the TaskBrowser:
	  <programlisting>  // Option 1:
  loadComponent("MyComponent", "CORBA")

  // Option 2:
  loadComponent("MyComponent.ior", "IORFile")

  // Option 3:
  loadComponent("IOR:.....", "IOR")</programlisting>
          which allows to quickly connect to a remote component once
          you can copy/paste the IOR into the console.

      <title>Setting up a deployable component library</title>
      <para>
	This section explains how to prepare a component library
	for deployment. It is demonstrated with an example.
      </para>
      <section>
	<title>Additional Code</title>
	<para>
	  There exist three C macros for preparing a component
	  library.  The simplest way is when the resulting library
	  will contain only one component type. Assume we have written
	  the <classname>OCL::HelloWorld</classname> component ( in
	  the OCL C++ namespace) which is compiled in the
	  <filename>orocos-helloworld.so</filename> library. The
	  following code is added to HelloWorld.cpp:
	</para>
	<programlisting>  #include "HelloWorld.hpp"
  #include &lt;ocl/Component.hpp&gt;

  /* ... Hello World implementation file ... */

  // You <emphasis>must</emphasis> specify the namespace:
  ORO_CREATE_COMPONENT( OCL::HelloWorld )</programlisting>
         <para>
	   This macro inserts a function into the library which will
	   allow the DeploymentComponent to create OCL::HelloWorld components.
	 </para>
	 <para>
	   In case multiple components are defined in the same
	   library, two other macros must be used. One macro for each
	   component type and one macro once for the whole
	   library. Say your library has components
	   NS::<classname>ComponentX</classname> and
	   NS::<classname>ComponentZ</classname> in namespace NS. In
	   order to export both components, you could write in
	   <filename>ComponentX.cpp</filename>:
	 </para>
	<programlisting>  #include "ComponentX.hpp"
  #include &lt;ocl/Component.hpp&gt;

  /* ... ComponentX implementation file ... */
  // <emphasis>once</emphasis>:
  ORO_CREATE_COMPONENT_TYPE()
  // <emphasis>For the ComponentX type</emphasis>:
  ORO_LIST_COMPONENT_TYPE( NS::ComponentX )</programlisting>
         <para>
	   and in <filename>ComponentY.cpp</filename> the same but without the
	   ORO_CREATE_COMPONENT_TYPE macro:
	 </para>
	<programlisting>  #include "ComponentY.hpp"
  #include &lt;ocl/Component.hpp&gt;

  /* ... ComponentY implementation file ... */

  // <emphasis>For the ComponentY type</emphasis>:
  ORO_LIST_COMPONENT_TYPE( NS::ComponentY )</programlisting>
         <para>
	   For each additional component in the same library,
	   the ORO_LIST_COMPONENT_TYPE macro is added. It is
	   allowed to put all the ORO_LIST_COMPONENT_TYPE macros
	   in a single file. 
	 </para>
	 <note>
	   <para>
	     You may not mix ORO_CREATE_COMPONENT and
	     ORO_CREATE_COMPONENT_TYPE/ORO_LIST_COMPONENT_TYPE macros
	     in one library. You must stick to one system, even
	     if you link libraries.
	   </para>
	 </note>
      </section>
      <section>
	<title>Compiling and linking a component library</title>
	<para>
	  In order to have a working library, care must be taken
	  of the compilation flags. You may compile your library
	  static or shared. But a static library will not be
	  dynamically loadable. In the final executable the
	  DeploymentComponent will be able to find the linked in
	  components and setup the application using the XML file.
	</para>
	<important>
	<para>
	  The macros need some help to figure out if you are compiling
	  a shared or static library. You need to define the
	  <emphasis>RTT_COMPONENT</emphasis> macro (see below) when
	  compiling for a shared library. If this macro is not
	  defined, it is assumed that you are compiling for a static
	  library.
	</para>
	</important>
	<para>
	  The compilation flag of a component for a shared library
	  might look like:
	</para>
	<programlisting>  CFLAGS= -O2 -Wall -fPIC -DRTT_COMPONENT
  LDFLAGS= -fPIC</programlisting>
	<para>
	  The compilation flag of a component for a static library
	  lacks both options :
	</para>
	<programlisting>  CFLAGS= -O2 -Wall
  LDFLAGS=</programlisting>
